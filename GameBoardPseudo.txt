IF a Player's location is updated during the MOVE SEQUENCE

	- Update "Old" Room's occupant list (i.e. oldRoom.removePlayer(Player))
	- Set Player's location to new Room (i.e. player.location = newRoom)
	- Update "New" Room's occupant list (i.e. newRoom.addPlayer(Player))

	Need to update Player icon on game board to new position

	need to have set positions to move PlayerSprites to for each room
		Hallways needs just one position
		Rooms need to have six different setups
			- 1 PlayerSprite, 2 PlayerSprites, 3 PlayerSprites, etc.

	Server will send player names and locations to ClientAppController, who passes to ClientGameBoard

	Runnable Thread will constantlly update sprite locations

	ClientGameBoard holds
		- list of locations
			- locations will hold
				- occupants
				- list of x,ys for each configuration of occupants
				- method to update occupant position within location based on number of occupants
